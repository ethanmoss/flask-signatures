# flask-signatures

Currently, this is a RESTful API that allows a user to create, read, update, and delete employee data into a SQLite database. This was developed as a personal project to extend functionality and provide further automation for managing organization email signatures.

## Future Plans

My plan is to build a fully functional web application complete with a RESTful API/relational database to manipulate user signatures. Possible integration with Google's Gmail API to simplify the process even further has been considered, although that remains to be seen.

The back-end (API and database) is currently in the works. The technologies I am using for this are Python, Flask micro-framework, SQLAlchemy, with a SQLite database. Basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) functionality to add/remove employees, as well as the ability to upload a CSV file to bulk add users is currently available.

The plan for the front-end is to build it out using React.
